# Some Common Transformation apply in the Data Science. 
1. Log Transformation:
    - Apply when data is highly right-skewed (e.g., income, price, population).
    - Helps compress large values.
    - Makes multiplicative relationships additive.
    - Formula: log(x+1) to handle zeros)
    - x' = log(x)

2. Square Root Transformation:
    - Used for moderate right skew.
    - Often applied to count data (like number of occurrences).
    - Formula: x' = np.sqrt(x)

3. Reciprocal Transformation:
    - Strongly reduces the impact of large values.
    - Used for highly skewed data.
    - Formula: x' = 1/x 
        (sometimes 1/(x+1) if zeros)

4. Box-Cox Transformation:
    - A parametric power transformation.
    - Automatically finds the best transformation (log, sqrt, etc.) to make data normal-like.
    - Only works if data is positive.
        x′ = x^λ - 1/λ If λ does not equal to zero.
        x′ = log(x) (if λ = 0 )
        (where, λ is automatically estimated)

5. Yeo-Johnson Transformation:
    - Like Box-Cox, but works with negative values too.
​    - Very useful when your data has both positive and negative numbers.

6.  Rank Transformation
    - Replace values by their ranks.
    - Useful in non-parametric statistics (e.g., Spearman correlation).

9. Logit Transformation
    - Used when the data is a proportion (values between 0 and 1).
    - Transforms data into the full real line.

## Scaling of Data. 
1. Z-score Standardization (Standard Scaling)
    - Center the data (mean = 0) and scale it (std = 1).
    - Useful for models sensitive to scale (e.g., KNN, SVM, Neural Networks).
    - Formula:
        x' = x - μ / std.

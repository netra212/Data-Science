# Bernouli Distribution
    - Probability distribution that models a binary outcomes, where the outcomes can be either success (represented by the value of 1) or failure (represented by the value of 0). 
    - It describes a random experiment that has exactly two possible outcomes. 
        Success (usually coded as 1)    
        Failure (usually coded as 0)
    Example:- 
        - Tossing a coin (Heads = 1, Tails = 0),
        - Checking if a machine works (Works = 1, Fails = 0),
        - Is the email spam? (Spam = 1, Not spam = 0).

    - Mathematical Definitions.
        If 𝑋 is a random variable following a Bernoulli distribution:
            P(X=1) = p
            P(X=0) = 1 − p
        where, p is the probabilty of success. 
    - Probability Mass function:
        P(X=x) = p^x * (1−p)^1−x for x ∈ {0, 1}

# Binomial Distribution:
    If we repeat multiple independent Bernoulli trials, it leads to a Binomial distribution.
        -> Bernoulli is one trial.
        -> Binomial is multiple trials.
    - Binomial Distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernouli trials.
    - In a simple words, 
        - We have `n` repeated experiements. 
        - Each experiment has only two outcomes (success = 1 or failure = 0).
        - Each trial has the same probability of success (p).
        - You want to know: " How many successes will I get ? ".

    - Real World Examples:
        a. Tossing a coin 10 times and counting how many heads you get.
        b. Testing 100 people for a disease and counting how many are positive.
        c. In email marketing, sending 200 emails and counting how many get opened.

    Mathematical Definition:
    If X∼Binomial(n,p), then:
        - n = number of trials
        - p = probability of success in one trial
        - X = number of successes (can be 0, 1, 2, ..., n)

    The Probability Mass Function (PMF):
        P (X = k) = (n_C_k) * p^x * (1 - p)^n-k

Notes:-
    The distribution is symmetric if p = 0.5,
    It is right-skewed if p < 0.5,
    It is left-skewed if p > 0.5.

```
Code:

from scipy.stats import binom
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

n = 10  # number of trials
p = 0.5  # probability of success

# x = possible number of successes
x = list(range(n+1))
pmf = binom.pmf(x, n, p)

plt.bar(x, pmf)
plt.title('Binomial Distribution (n=10, p=0.5)')
plt.xlabel('Number of Successes')
plt.ylabel('Probability')
plt.show()
```

# Sampling Distribution:
- Sampling distribution is a probability distribution of a sample statistic such as (like mean, proportion, variance) calculated from many samples of the same size, drawn from the same population.
- In simple word, Imagine we keep taking samples from a population, calculate a value (like the sample mean) each time, and then plot all those values — that plot is the sampling distribution.
    
    Example to Understand:
    - Suppose the average height of all students in a school is unknown.
    - we take a random sample of 30 students, measure their average height.
    - Then we take another sample of 30 students, measure again.
    - Keep repeating this many times.
    - Now, we have many sample means.
    - The distribution of all these sample means is the sampling distribution of the mean.

# Key Ideas:
Concept	Meaning
    Population  ->	The full group you're interested in (e.g., all students in the school).
    Sample	    ->  A smaller group picked randomly from the population (e.g., 30 students).
    Statistic	->  A number you calculate from the sample (e.g., sample mean height).
    Sampling Distribution	-> Distribution of the statistic (like mean) across many samples.

Sampling Distribution is important because it allows us to understand how much our sample statisitcs varies. Also, they are essential for the hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. 
Also, tells us how reliable our sample estimate is.

```
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a population
population = np.random.normal(loc=50, scale=10, size=10000)

# Create sampling distribution
sample_means = []
for _ in range(1000):
    sample = np.random.choice(population, size=30)
    sample_means.append(np.mean(sample))

# Plot
plt.hist(sample_means, bins=30, edgecolor='black', density=True)
plt.title('Sampling Distribution of the Sample Mean')
plt.xlabel('Sample Mean')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()

# Bernouli Distribution
    - Probability distribution that models a binary outcomes, where the outcomes can be either success (represented by the value of 1) or failure (represented by the value of 0). 
    - It describes a random experiment that has exactly two possible outcomes. 
        Success (usually coded as 1)    
        Failure (usually coded as 0)
    Example:- 
        - Tossing a coin (Heads = 1, Tails = 0),
        - Checking if a machine works (Works = 1, Fails = 0),
        - Is the email spam? (Spam = 1, Not spam = 0).

    - Mathematical Definitions.
        If 𝑋 is a random variable following a Bernoulli distribution:
            P(X=1) = p
            P(X=0) = 1 − p
        where, p is the probabilty of success. 
    - Probability Mass function:
        P(X=x) = p^x * (1−p)^1−x for x ∈ {0, 1}

# Binomial Distribution:
    If we repeat multiple independent Bernoulli trials, it leads to a Binomial distribution.
        -> Bernoulli is one trial.
        -> Binomial is multiple trials.
    - Binomial Distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernouli trials.
    - In a simple words, 
        - We have `n` repeated experiements. 
        - Each experiment has only two outcomes (success = 1 or failure = 0).
        - Each trial has the same probability of success (p).
        - You want to know: " How many successes will I get ? ".

    - Real World Examples:
        a. Tossing a coin 10 times and counting how many heads you get.
        b. Testing 100 people for a disease and counting how many are positive.
        c. In email marketing, sending 200 emails and counting how many get opened.

    Mathematical Definition:
    If X∼Binomial(n,p), then:
        - n = number of trials
        - p = probability of success in one trial
        - X = number of successes (can be 0, 1, 2, ..., n)

    The Probability Mass Function (PMF):
        P (X = k) = (n_C_k) * p^x * (1 - p)^n-k

Notes:-
    The distribution is symmetric if p = 0.5,
    It is right-skewed if p < 0.5,
    It is left-skewed if p > 0.5.

```
Code:

from scipy.stats import binom
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

n = 10  # number of trials
p = 0.5  # probability of success

# x = possible number of successes
x = list(range(n+1))
pmf = binom.pmf(x, n, p)

plt.bar(x, pmf)
plt.title('Binomial Distribution (n=10, p=0.5)')
plt.xlabel('Number of Successes')
plt.ylabel('Probability')
plt.show()
```
